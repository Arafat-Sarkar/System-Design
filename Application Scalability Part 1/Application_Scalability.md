# Application Scalability :
Application scalability is the ability of an application to handle increased users, traffic, or workload efficiently by adding resources, without losing performance.
---

**Performance vs Scaling:**
Performance: How fast and efficiently an application responds with current resources (latency, speed).
Scaling: How well an application handles more load by adding resources (users, traffic).
Performance = speed now
Scaling = ability to grow

**Types of Scaling:**
Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):
Increase resources of a single server (CPU, RAM).
Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):
Add more servers to share the load.

## 2. Vertical Scaling

**Pros of Vertical Scaling:**
The advantages of vertical scaling include easy implementation, improved performance by upgrading a single server, simpler management, and no need for architectural changes or load balancing.
---

**Cons of Vertical Scaling:**
The disadvantages of vertical scaling include limited scalability due to hardware limits, higher costs, potential downtime during upgrades, and the risk of a single point of failure.
---

**When to use Vertical Scaling:**
- When application is simple or runs on a single server
- When adding more servers is difficult or unnecessary
- When short-term performance boost is needed quickly
- When cost of managing multiple servers is higher than upgrading one server
